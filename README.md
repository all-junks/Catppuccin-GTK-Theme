A Catppuccin-based (Original Catppuccin theme by Fausto-Korpsvart, based on the Catppuccin community theme) for Pop!_OS lovers like me. This was built all because the COSMIC Epoch DE was WAY too unstable for my Pop!_OS, but the only thing I liked in my horribly & mistakenly installed DE was the theme itself. So I decided to build this theme, just for you all & the best part is that you don't need to live with a terrible testing DE (No offence to System76 BTW)

This theme's accent is based on the Catppuccin Frappé Sky accent theme
